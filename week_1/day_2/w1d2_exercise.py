# ITP Week 1 Day 2 Exercise

# We will replicate a number magic trick with Python! Below is the magic trick that we will convert!
# Below that is the python instructions, you will need to complete.

# Step 1: Pick a number from 1 to 9
# Step 2: Multiply by 2
# Step 3: Add 10 to the total
# Step 4: Divide by 2
# Step 5: Subtract by the original number
# Final Number: 5

# assign a variable "step_1" to a number of your choice between 1 - 9
step_1 = 9

# assign a variable "step_2" to the product of step_1 and the number 2
step_2 = step_1 * 2

# assign a variable "step_3" to the sum of step_2 and the number 10
step_3 = step_2 + 10

# assign a variable "step_4" to the quotient of step_3 and the number 2
step_4 = step_3 / 2

# assign a variable "step_5" to the difference between step_4 and step_1
step_5 = step_4 - step_1

# print step_5 and you should see 5!
print(step_5)

# BONUS 1: can you convert step_1 to prompt a user's input?
    # HINT: you need to cast step_1 to an int because user input is a type string.
bonus_step1 = int(input("Enter a number between 1 and 9:"))
print(bonus_step1, type(bonus_step1))

# BONUS 2: can you REFACTOR using fewer variables?
